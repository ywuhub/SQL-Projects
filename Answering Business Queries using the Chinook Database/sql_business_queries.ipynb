Also, we see that Rock has been the main contributor of the genres sold in the USA accounting for 53% of the total USA track sales. This gives a rough idea on what the USA population likes to listen to and purchase from this store. So, it maybe wise to load up on more Rock music artists to increase sales in this music store business.\n",

    "<b>Comment:</b> Here, it is clear that the highest sales total and customer count is from the \"Other\" group. The countries in the \"Other\" group are Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Chile, Denmark, Finland, Hungary,        Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Spain and Sweden who all only have 1 customer each in the database. However, since they are all grouped up because of their small sample size we can not conclude that selling to all these countries increases profit. Although, we can conclude that USA as the next best in terms of the amount of customers and total sales. But, the highest country with the best average sale amount per customer belongs to Czech Republic with $9.11."
