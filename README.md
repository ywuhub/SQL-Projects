# SQL-Projects

This repository contains all the SQL projects that I have done using Python or R and SQLITE3. The project link below will be in ascending order of the completion date, so that means the further down the list, the more recent the project is.

## Python + SQL:
- [The World Factbook](https://github.com/ywuhub/SQL-Projects/blob/master/Analyzing%20The%20World%20Factbook/Analyzing-The-World-Factbook.ipynb)
- [Answering Business Queries with Chinook Database](https://github.com/ywuhub/SQL-Projects/blob/master/Answering%20Business%20Queries%20using%20the%20Chinook%20Database/sql_business_queries.ipynb)
